# The Codefun Exam Team

## What we do

We are currently working on Codefun Debug, a website that utilizes submission data from Natsu Kagami's Codefun OJ to generate code-debugging problems. See it live at https://debug.codefun.vn.

The project's Docker images are minhnhatnoe/codefun-debug-backend, minhnhatnoe/codefun-debug-frontend, minhnhatnoe/codefun-debug-proxy on Docker Hub. Documentations for these images are underway.

## About us

We are schoolmates from HUS High School for Gifted Students, working together to realize different ideas.

We are a group of three:
- KB: Frontend Developer
- Unknown1508: Backend Developer and DBA
- minhnhatnoe: Sysadmin, DevOps, and Project Manager

Also, this team wouldn't have existed without the help of Mr. Ho Dac Phuong and Natsu Kagami.
